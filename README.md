# Fun Flash Cards

Fun Flash Cards is an application I made with my daugher (6yrs old) to help
with her reading.

During first grade, the kids are required to learn to identify some words
immediately, which helps a lot with reading speed.

We do those normally on flash cards we make together.

Since we are in the process of learning logic and learning how to code as well
I thought it's gonna be fun to try and whip up an application together.

Feel free to check it out and use it. Right now I don't have real plans with it
but I might release it to the app store one day, just for the fun of it.
